# Python WOWL downloader

Python script to download WOWL data ---> read_wowl.py.

read_wowl.py contains the functions that can connect to a WOWL and download the data. Sending data to server and location is currently not supported.

There seems to be a bug with the python bluetooth module (bleak) for Windows and code may error when connecting. We are working to fix this and it might run on other OS although it is untested.

More documentation and functionality for this code base will continue to be added.
